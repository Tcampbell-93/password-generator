# password-generator

## Description

In this project I was given starter code and had to write a function to generate a random password.
The user can choose to which types of characters they want and between 8 and 128 characters long.
In this project I learned a lot about the basics of javascript such as for loops and Math.random.

## Usage

When you click the generate password button you will be prompted to choose between 8 and 128 characters.
Then it will prompt you if you want to add numbers, special characters, and upper case letters.
Once you have choosen all the prompts your password will show up in the text box.
